# Data Source and Representation:
    - Data Source: Refers to the origin of data, which can be internal (within an organization) or external (outside the organization). Examples include databases, data warehouses, and data lakes.
    - Data Representation: Involves how data is formatted and structured. This can include tabular data, text data, image data, and more. Proper representation is crucial for effective data analysis.

# Data Cleansing:
    - Importance: Ensures data accuracy and reliability by removing errors and inconsistencies.
    - Techniques: Includes handling missing values, correcting errors, and removing duplicates. This step is essential to prepare data for analysis.

# Types of Data:
    - Categorical Data: Data that can be divided into specific categories, such as gender or blood type.
    - Numerical Data: Data that represents numbers and can be discrete (countable) or continuous (measurable).
    - Discrete Data: Countable data, such as the number of students in a class.
    - Continuous Data: Measurable data, such as height or weight.
# Data Preparation:
    - Data Extraction: The process of retrieving data from various sources.
    - Data Integration: Combining data from different sources into a unified view.
    - Data Transformation: Converting data into a suitable format for analysis.
    - Data Reduction: Reducing the volume of data while maintaining its integrity, often through techniques like sampling or dimensionality reduction.
# Data Quality Issues:
    - Missing Values: Occur when data entries are incomplete.
    - Noisy Data: Contains errors or outliers.
    - Inconsistency: Data that does not follow a consistent format or pattern.
    - Lack of Uniformity: Variations in data that should be standardized.
    - Misspellings: Errors in text data.
    - Duplicate Data: Repeated entries that need to be removed.
# Data Integration:
    - Process: Involves combining data from different sources to provide a comprehensive view.
    - Challenges: Includes dealing with data heterogeneity and ensuring data consistency.
# Data Transformation:
    - Purpose: To convert data into a format suitable for analysis.
    - Methods: Includes normalization, aggregation, and discretization.
# Data Reduction:
    - Techniques: Includes dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA) and data compression.
    - Goal: To simplify data without losing important information, making analysis more efficient.
# Data Cleansing Techniques:
    - Handling Missing Values: Techniques include imputation (filling in missing values) and deletion (removing incomplete records).
    - Dealing with Noisy Data: Methods include smoothing (e.g., using moving averages) and outlier detection.
    - Ensuring Consistency: Standardizing data formats and correcting inconsistencies.
