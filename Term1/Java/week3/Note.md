@ There are 3 stage when performing a task: (Input-Process-Output)(Block Diagram)

@ Execute task has 3 ways:
_ Sequence Structure
_ Decision Structure
_ Iteration Structure (Loop)

@ RAM : random access memory

@ Java rules:
_ case sensitive
_ special character sensitive
_ use function names as veriable is wrong

@ White space:
_ \t : tab
_ \n : new line
_ \f : use in print to new page
_ \r : erase the front text
_ \b : backspace
_ \' : single quote
_ \xxx : unicode character

@ Literal:
_ interger Literal : byte, short, int, long
_ floating-point Literal : float, double
_ boolean Literal : True, False
_ character literal : Textual
_ string literal : Textual

@ Increment @ decrement:
_ ++x = x + 1
_ x++ = x + 2
_ --x = x - 1
_ x-- = x - 2

@ Arithmatic expression: execute order
1. ()
2. ++,--
3. *,/,%
4. +,-
5. =,+=,-=,/=,%=

@ Data type conversion:
_ Implicit conversion: Take the latest declaration
_ explicit conversion: declare it when needed

@ Exampe of int x float:
1. 5/2 = 2
2. 5.0 / 2.0 = 2.5
3. 5.0 / 2 = 2.5
4. 5 / 2.0 = 2.5
When float meet int will be float

@ Constant:
_ used by final to make the data type unchangeable
+ example: final (data type) variable = values;

note: when a number as char in math, it will have the value of binary
