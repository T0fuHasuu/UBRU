Introduction
@ Before writing a program, it is necessary to analyze the problem and
design the program because it will help make the programmer's thought process have a sequence
of steps.

@ Code should be incude the block diagram : 

INPUT --> PROCESS --> OUTPUT
ENTER --> CALCULA --> DISPLAY

@ Algorithm are step by step of execution to get desired results

@ When designing a programm:
_ Know what you want to display
_ defining varaible so the machine understand and go to the process
_ write algorithm
_ Verify if theres errors

@ FLowchart : Is use to show steps of a program
_ ANSI: American National Standard institute

@ Ways of execute:
_ Sequence Structure: execute in order
_ Decision Structure: execute by decide true or false
_ Iteration Structure: execute in a loop hole till condition falls of.

@ To write efficiently:
1. **Order**: Write symbols in the sequence of the process steps.
2. **Symbols**: Use appropriate symbols for each step.
3. **Connections**: Ensure every symbol has a connecting point; no floating symbols.
4. **Direction**: Start the flowchart from the top and work downwards.
5. **Complexity**: Use connection symbols for complex flowcharts.
6. **End**: Ensure the flowchart has a clear end.
7. **Descriptions**: Keep work descriptions brief.

@ Flowchart rules:
_ You dont need declare variable in flowchart since it to tell step not machine

@ Pseudocode : describes program steps in plain English, following a structured format similar to code. It clarifies logic before coding, complementing flowcharts.

@ Rules for writing pseudocode
1. Write 1 command per line.
2. If it is a specific word (Keyword), write it in capital letters. Specific words are orders to perform an
action. They are usually the first word of the sentence. and is a word similar to the command in
Computer languages ​​such as ADD, READ, WRITE, IF, etc.
3. If there is a Decision and Iteration work structure, the commands in the structure There
should be a paragraph.
4. The IF, WHILE...DO, and REPEAT...UNTIL statements should always have an END... statement at
the end of the structure. Makes reading pseudocode easier.
