ARRAY

@ Declaring :
datatype [] arrayName = new datatype[n];
datatype arrayName [] = new datatype[n];
ex : int score [] = new int[10];

@ Array Elements :
ex : int score [] = {56,53,23,23};

@ Binary Search : Binary search is a highly efficient search algorithm used to find the position of a specific value (target value) within a sorted array. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

@ Sort :
1. Bubble sort
2. Selection sort
3. Insertion sort

@ Dimension :
1. 2D : in a form of int value[a][b] = {{...},....}
2. 3D : in a form of int[][][] numbers = {
    {{1, 2}, {3, 4}, {5, 6}},
    {{7, 8}, {9, 10}, {11, 12}},
    {{13, 14}, {15, 16}, {17, 18}}
};
