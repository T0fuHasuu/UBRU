# OOP (objects oriented program) : is the process of taking the objects which already created and design it to our liking.

@ Alternative : it's like a fucntion which has function in it and variable.

# Innitialize structure : Public void name (DATATYPE VARIABLE, ..., ..){
    name.variable = VARIABLE;
    ...
    ...
    }
    ex :     
    public dog(String name, String color, String gender, int stamina){
        this.name = name;
        this.color = color;
        this.gender = gender;
        this.stamina = stamina;
    }

# Usage of Innitial Structure :
    ex : dog mydog1 = new dog("Nulear Destroyer", "RED", "Male", 5);
    

Class : declare as " public class name{...}"

# Give values in the Main :
    ex : mydog1.color = "Red";
         mydog1.gender = "Male";
