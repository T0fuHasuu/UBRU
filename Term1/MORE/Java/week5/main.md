@ Iterative Statement : Loop can be used with:

1. for() : used by initial,condition,incre/decrement
# used for how mamy time u want to loop 

2. while() : used by condition until it turns false 
# have something do until false condition

3. do{} while() : it's used to by statements and then a condition in the while
# Mostly used to have the first statement execute and then check whether the condition true or false, if true then repeat the loop and false move on to another part.

@ Follow-up : things to be add at the end of statements

1. break() : this is used to break something when the condition is met and move to another part.

2. continue() : this is used to skip condition that are false and continue check every other condition which are true

@ Nest loop : it's where a loop is being used in another loop but it connects to the outer layer of ther core loop.
