This is a comprehensive overview of algorithms, from their basic definition to the key qualities of a well-designed algorithm. It also touches on the process of designing and analyzing algorithms.

@ Algorithm are steps which are needed to be follow to get the desired result.

_ These step can be execute via computer and algorithm is what live with us everyday as process of doing things.

@ What is the best quality of algorithm? It consist of :

_ Clarity : steps should be clear and unambiguous
_ Sequence : steps should be sort and execute in order and logically.
_ Correctness : algorithm should produce output whenever valid input is entered.
_ Efficiency : The algorithm should use resources (time and space) efficiently.
_ Termination :
