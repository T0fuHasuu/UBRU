1. Find the Minimum Value in `Array_1`  
   Write an algorithm in Thai/English to display the minimum value in `Array_1`, which has `n` elements.

2. Sort `Array_1` in Ascending Order  
   Write a pseudo-code algorithm to sort the data in `Array_1` from smallest to largest.

3. Display Prime Numbers in `Array_1`  
   Write a pseudo-code algorithm to display the prime numbers in `Array_1`.

4. Fibonacci Sequence  
   Write an algorithm in Thai/English to display the sum of the two preceding numbers in the Fibonacci sequence, when asked for the value at position `n`. For example, the 10th number is 34 (sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34).

5. Coin Exchange Problem  
   Write an algorithm in Thai/English to exchange a total amount of money using the fewest coins, where the available coins are 10 Baht, 5 Baht, 2 Baht, and 1 Baht. For example, if the user inputs 57 Baht, the algorithm should show how to give the minimum number of coins.

6. Traffic Light Control  
   Write a pseudo-code algorithm to control traffic lights for four directions (North, South, East, West). Each direction has a 20-second green light, along with a countdown timer for the green light and a countdown for the red light while waiting for the next green light.
