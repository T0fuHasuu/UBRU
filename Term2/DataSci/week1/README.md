# Data Science contains with :
    1. DATA : real info which gathered into qualitiative and quantitative varaible.
    2. SCIENCE : to figure out how and why such testable explaination and predictions about the everything.

    Meaning : To use figuring everything out from the datasheet and predicts of what about to come next.

# What is Data Science :
    1. It is to create new variable with various of categories combined
    2. it consists of  managing, storing, collecting, verifying, analyzing, researching data, and presenting the analysis results
    3. Data Science integrates knowledge from technology, statistics, and business to analyze large datasets, also known as Big Data
    4. Its applications span various fields, such as business, logistics, economics, finance, medicine, engineering, information technology, public health, and more

# AI + Big Data + Data Science :
    1. Ai : well-known with being fast learnt and efficient
    2. Big Data : is a massive value and varieties of data
    3. Data Science : which use ai to analyze the outcome of big data

# Data Type :
    1. Structured data : Data stored in a table format, consisting of rows and columns.
    2. Unstructured data : Data such as text on websites, Twitter, Facebook, images, audio files, and videos.
    3. Semi-Structured data : Data with a flexible structure that can be expanded in the future and accessed quickly.

# About Data Science :
    1. Understand the problem and translate it into a data analysis question, then outline a preliminary action plan.
    2. Data Acquistion : data can be gain from questionairs, web servers, web services (API), database, logs and online repositories.
    3. Process of picking : 
        _ data selection : get data
        _ data cleaning : correct and fix noise, missing, value, outliner
        _ data transformation : make it to analyze
    4. Exploratory data analysis : select which variable you want to use in the process of model developing.
    5. Data Modeling : Taking dataset training and have mathematical to scribe it off with algorithm turning into trained model.
    6. Visualization & Communication : create powerl reports, convince stakeholders.
    7. Deploy & Maintenance : test for confirmation before deploy.

# To train model :
    1. Take data set and tost it into the algorithm sorting
