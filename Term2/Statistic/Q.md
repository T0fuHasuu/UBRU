- **Answer:** Descriptive statistics summarize and present data in a meaningful way using numbers and graphs, such as mean, median, mode, and range.

### **5. Define the mean and its formula.**
- **Answer:** The mean is the average value of a data set. The formula is:
  \[
  \text{Mean} = \frac{\sum X}{N}
  \]
  where \( \sum X \) is the sum of all values, and \( N \) is the total number of values.

### **6. How do you find the median?**
- **Answer:** The median is the middle value when the data is ordered. If the data set has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.

- **Answer:** The chi-square test compares observed and expected frequencies for categorical data. The formula is:
  \[
  \chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O - E)^2}{E}
  \]
  where \( O \) is the observed frequency and \( E \) is the expected frequency.

- **Answer:** The formula for a z-test is:
  \[
  Z = \frac{\text{Sample Mean} - \text{Population Mean}}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{N}}}
  \]
  where \( \sigma \) is the population standard deviation and \( N \) is the sample size.

- **Answer:** The alternative hypothesis assumes that there is a significant effect or difference between variables.

### **20. How do you determine the sample size for research?**
- **Answer:** The sample size is calculated using the formula:
  \[
  n = \frac{N}{1 + N(e^2)}
  \]
  where \( n \) is the sample size, \( N \) is the population size, and \( e \) is the margin of error.

### **21. What are independent and dependent variables?**
- **Answer:** The independent variable is the factor manipulated in the experiment, while the dependent variable is the factor measured.

### **22. What is the difference between a one-tailed and a two-tailed test?**
- **Answer:** A one-tailed test checks for an effect in one direction, while a two-tailed test checks for any difference, regardless of direction.

### **23. What is the formula for a one-sample t-test?**
- **Answer:** The formula for a one-sample t-test compares the sample mean to the population mean:
  \[
  t = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\frac{S}{\sqrt{n}}}
  \]

- **Answer:** Control variables are factors held constant to prevent them from influencing the outcome of the study, ensuring accurate results.

### **29. What does the F-statistic in ANOVA represent?**
- **Answer:** The F-statistic compares the variance between group means to the variance within groups to determine if there are significant differences.

### **30. What are ethical considerations in research?**
- **Answer:** Ethical considerations include obtaining informed consent, ensuring confidentiality, and maintaining objectivity in the research process.

### **1. What is the difference between raw data and processed data?**
- **Answer:** Raw data is collected directly in its original form, while processed data has been organized, cleaned, or transformed for analysis.

### **2. How do you determine the class intervals in group data?**
- **Answer:** Class intervals are determined by dividing the data range into equal intervals, based on the number of intervals chosen and the data's range.

### **3. What are the key components of descriptive statistics?**
- **Answer:** Descriptive statistics involve measures like the mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and graphical representations like histograms and bar charts.

### **4. What is the significance of the median in a data set?**
- **Answer:** The median is the middle value that separates the higher half and the lower half of the data, making it less sensitive to extreme values compared to the mean.

### **5. What happens to the mean and median in a skewed distribution?**
- **Answer:** In a positively skewed distribution, the mean is greater than the median. In a negatively skewed distribution, the mean is less than the median.

### **6. How do you calculate the mode in a dataset with no repeated values?**
- **Answer:** If no value is repeated, the data set has no mode.

### **7. How is the standard deviation different from the variance?**
- **Answer:** Standard deviation is the square root of the variance, providing a measure of spread in the same unit as the original data, while variance is the squared measure of spread.

### **8. How do you interpret the range of a dataset?**
- **Answer:** The range represents the difference between the highest and lowest values in the dataset, indicating the spread of the data.

### **9. What is the interquartile range (IQR) and how is it calculated?**
- **Answer:** The IQR is the difference between the third quartile (Q3) and first quartile (Q1), representing the middle 50% of the data. Formula:  
  \[
  \text{IQR} = Q3 - Q1
  \]

### **10. When would you use a Z-test over a t-test?**
- **Answer:** A Z-test is used when the sample size is large (typically >30) or the population standard deviation is known, while a t-test is used with smaller sample sizes or unknown population standard deviations.

### **11. What is the assumption for using a t-test in hypothesis testing?**
- **Answer:** A t-test assumes that the sample data are approximately normally distributed and the data are independent.

### **12. What is the difference between a one-sample t-test and a two-sample t-test?**
- **Answer:** A one-sample t-test compares the mean of a single sample to a known population mean, while a two-sample t-test compares the means of two independent groups.

### **13. How is the F-statistic used in ANOVA?**
- **Answer:** The F-statistic in ANOVA compares the variance between group means to the variance within groups to determine if the means are significantly different.

### **14. What is the null hypothesis in a chi-square test?**
- **Answer:** The null hypothesis in a chi-square test states that there is no significant difference between the observed and expected frequencies.

### **15. What does a high p-value in hypothesis testing indicate?**
- **Answer:** A high p-value suggests that the observed data is consistent with the null hypothesis, and there is not enough evidence to reject it.

### **16. What does the confidence interval represent in hypothesis testing?**
- **Answer:** The confidence interval represents a range of values within which the population parameter is likely to fall, with a specified level of confidence (e.g., 95%).

### **17. How do you test the significance of a correlation?**
- **Answer:** You can use Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) and calculate its significance using a hypothesis test to determine if the correlation is statistically significant.

### **18. What is the difference between a simple correlation and a multiple correlation?**
- **Answer:** Simple correlation measures the relationship between two variables, while multiple correlation examines the relationship between one dependent variable and several independent variables.

### **19. How do you calculate the degrees of freedom for a t-test?**
- **Answer:** For a one-sample t-test, degrees of freedom is \( n - 1 \), where \( n \) is the sample size. For a two-sample t-test, it is \( n_1 + n_2 - 2 \), where \( n_1 \) and \( n_2 \) are the sample sizes of the two groups.

### **26. What is the formula for calculating sample size when margin of error is given?**
- **Answer:** The formula is:
  \[
  n = \frac{N}{1 + N(e^2)}
  \]
  where \( n \) is the sample size, \( N \) is the population size, and \( e \) is the margin of error.

### **27. What is the importance of random sampling in research?**
- **Answer:** Random sampling ensures that every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected, helping to reduce bias and making the sample representative.

### **28. What is the purpose of regression analysis?**
- **Answer:** Regression analysis is used to analyze and model the relationship between one or more independent variables and a dependent variable to make predictions.

### **29. How do you interpret a p-value less than 0.05 in hypothesis testing?**
- **Answer:** A p-value less than 0.05 indicates that the observed data is statistically significant, and the null hypothesis is rejected.

### **30. How do you calculate the percentage change in data?**
- **Answer:** The percentage change is calculated using the formula:
  \[
  \text{Percentage Change} = \frac{\text{New Value} - \text{Old Value}}{\text{Old Value}} \times 100
