## 3.1: Wireless Networks

A **wireless network** allows communication between devices without using cables, relying on radio waves or other technologies. It’s divided into various types based on usage and coverage area.

### **Personal Area Network (PAN)**
- **Range:** Small, typically up to 10 meters.
- **Use:** Connecting personal devices nearby.

**Technologies:**
- **Bluetooth:** Connects devices like headphones and speakers.
- **ZigBee:** Used in IoT devices (smart homes).
- **Infrared (IR):** Short-range signal (e.g., remote controls).

### **Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)**
- **Use:** Covers small to medium areas, such as homes or offices.
- **Technologies:**
  - **Wi-Fi:** Most common, with coverage depending on the environment.
  - **Light Communication:** Uses light for data transfer, reducing interference.

### **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)**
- **Use:** Covers larger areas like cities or metropolitan regions.
- **Technologies:** Utilizes mobile networks for high-speed internet.

### **Wide Area Network (WAN)**
- **Use:** Covers large geographical areas like countries or continents.
- **Technologies:**
  - **Mobile Networks:** Internet connection and mobile communication.
  - **Satellite:** Provides internet in remote areas.

### **Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)**
- **Use:** Collects environmental data and sends it wirelessly.
- **Use Cases:** Weather monitoring, earthquake detection, smart agriculture.

### **Ad-Hoc Wireless Network**
- **Use:** Temporary networks without permanent infrastructure.
- **Use Cases:** Emergency systems, temporary meetings.

**Advantages:**
- No cables required
- Mobility support
- Easy setup

**Disadvantages:**
- Security risks (vulnerable to attacks)
- Signal interference
- Limited range

### **Smartphones and Connectivity**

Smartphones also use wireless technologies for various connections:

**Global Positioning System (GPS)**  
- **Function:** Uses satellites for location accuracy (typically within 10 meters).
  
**Hotspot:**  
- Public areas with network access.

**Bluetooth:**  
- Low-power technology for short-range communication.
- Connects multiple devices simultaneously (e.g., speakers, headphones).

**Near Field Communication (NFC):**  
- **Function:** Short-range data transfer, used for mobile payments.

### **Mobile Devices and Connectivity**

Mobile devices allow us to work, learn, and communicate anywhere. With wireless services (e.g., Wi-Fi in cafes and campuses), students can access resources, register, attend lectures, and submit assignments without needing a physical connection.

**Best Practices for Security:**
- Avoid sending sensitive information (like passwords) via unsecured messages.
- Use encrypted connections when transmitting sensitive data.
