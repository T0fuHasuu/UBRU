### Electromagnetic Spectrum
- Data signals transmitted are in the form of electromagnetic energy.
- Important parameters are wavelength (nanometers) and frequency (Hertz).

### Twisted Pair Cable
- **Types**: Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP), with categories ranging from CAT1 to CAT7.
- **Applications**: Used in telephone lines (CAT1), local area networks (LAN) with varying speeds (CAT2 to CAT7).

### Coaxial Cable
- **Structure**: Central copper wire with insulating layers and an outer conductor.
- **Pros**: Good for long-distance transmission and resistant to signal interference.
- **Cons**: Expensive, bulky, and difficult to install.

### Fiber Optic Cable
- **Material**: Made from glass or plastic, with the core transmitting light signals.
- **Types**: Single-mode (for long distances) and multi-mode (for shorter distances).
- **Pros**: High-speed data transmission and minimal signal loss.

### Wireless Transmission
- **Radio Waves**: Used in AM/FM radio, television, and mobile phones.
- **Microwaves**: Used for long-distance communication and satellite links.
- **Satellite Communication**: Uses up-link and down-link signals between earth stations and satellites.
- **Infrared, Bluetooth, and Laser**: Used for short-range communication, with lasers being particularly fast but affected by weather conditions.
